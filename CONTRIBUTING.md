Check our issue queue in OSEE Jira space first to see if anyone else has already reported the issue.
Create a new issue and tell us about the problem that you see.
The maintainer of this section will be alerted and work with you to decide what changes should be made
If invited to do so, create a pull request in the GitHub repository, including the issue number and short description in the pull request title, for example:{Jira issue number} - {short description of the change}. Note that pull requests that do not mention an associated issue number will not be alerted to our maintainers
Once the issue describes the reason for a change and links to the change you propose, a maintainer for that component is alerted
The maintainer will work with you to ensure that the change meets our standards for inclusion
We value all contributions to the project and, even if the change is not accepted, we always strive to give feedback that helps you understand the decisions taken.
